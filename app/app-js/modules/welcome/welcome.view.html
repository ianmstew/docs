  <h1>What APINetwork Does</h1>
  <p>API Network is an open source protocol for developers which easily links data and actions across personal emails, social networks, texts, cloud storage, contacts, calendars, and anything else you can think of. The goal of API Network is to take all the APIs out in the world, and provide a universal mechanism for querying them.</p>
  <p>Every piece of data that can be recovered has a URI associated with it. This URI contains the user identification information, as well as a reference to the data that we want to recover. You can view <a href="https://github.com/APINetwork/personal-data-module#usage" target="_blank" data-bypass>sample URI usage</a> and <a href="https://github.com/APINetwork/personal-data-module/blob/master/README.md#sample-uris" target="_blank" data-bypass>a list of sample URIs here</a>.</p>
